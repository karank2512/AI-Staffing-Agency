/**
 * Runtime public surface (contract: docs/CONTRACTS.md § runtime, types in ./types).
 *
 * A durable, DB-backed execution engine: `enqueueRun` puts work on the queue, the executor (or `executeRun`
 * inline) drives a run from its checkpoint through the blueprint's components, pausing for approvals and
 * surviving restarts. Everything here is org-scoped and every executor write to a Run is fenced by its lease.
